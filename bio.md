---


I have been playing music since at a very young age around the area of Manila, Philippines where I grew up.
I grew up in the culture where I was surrounded by a multitude of different genres from traditional filipino folk songs, to western pop.
Throughout the years accumulated a style of my own influenced by massive array of 
music.

I've incorporated these styles into my own music which can be found throughout my own original songs and covers. Currently I write my own songs for my solo project [Electric Dharma](http://electricdharma.bandcamp.com) and I also play the drums for a band called [dis-Ease](http://dis-ease.bandcamp.com). I perform regularly around the New Brunswick, New Jersey area.
